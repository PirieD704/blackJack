#BlackJack game using jQuery/JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

##The JavaScript has three primary buttons. Deal, hit, and stand. There is a reset button that appears at the completion of each hand. This is when the total for the bank gets the bet added to it if the player won. There are four separate amounts that can be bet (5, 10, 50, 100).  Your bet is subtracted from the bank and displayed above the table.

###The table is setup with Boostrap. Some features to note on it is that you cannot go beyond the limit that is in your bank.  You cannot continue to bet or redeal after the cards are dealt until the hand is finished.  You cannot view the dealer's first card or their total until you have completed your decisions.
